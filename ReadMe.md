### Hey! ðŸ‘‹
---
I'm currently working at Deloitte Canada (Omnia AI) as an SWE and building an internal tool to help accelerate Azure platform deployment

<br />


Over the past few years I've had the opportunity to complete my coop/internship terms at 4 different firms in Ottawa and meet amazing people.

I'm passionate about projects that are customer-focused and are consumer-based. 


Fun fact: - When I worked as a security guard during early university years, I met Justin Bieber's dad at EY center at a ComicCon in Ottawa and following that evening, was assigned a shift for Justin's concert :D
